			<h3>So, website is done.</h3>
			<p>Huzzahs and hail baby. The project website is finally done-ish.</p>
			<p>Well I suppose I should write something here, marking our first post. Updates would be in order I think.</p>
			<p>The progress so far on the Baofeng UV-5R manual is coming along great! We have several chapters "done" and more to come. The idea is still to push version 1.0 when the content of the original manual has been converted, adding more data in consecutive versions.</p>
			<p>On that note, previously we figured that we'd release a gritty 0.9 version to the public until we got all the image rendering in the toolchain working correctly. This has since been scrapped. The current goal is: Get v1.0 ready and out the door on the primary target, i.e. PDF for print. Worry about e-books later.</p>
			<p>No worries, you e-book users out there. Optimized versions are coming. Meanwhile we've established a path in the toolchain to produce iPad-optimized PDFs in addition to the print-optimized PDFs. So if you planned to read your manual on your favourite slate computer system, we've got you covered.</p>
