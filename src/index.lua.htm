			<h3>Project is not dead, just a temporary hiatus</h3>
			<p>Due to personal reasons work on the manual has slowed down considerably, for the moment. The manual will however be completed and released, that is guaranteed. Unfortunately this means that the release will have to be pushed back yet again. We're very sorry for all the delays.</p>
			<p>Currently we're hoping for a release sometime before November 10th.</p>

			<h3>The UV-5R has arrived!</h3>
			<p>Finally, after a long wait, the Baofeng UV-5R (and programming cable!) found its way here. Now the real work begins: Figuring out how the radio really works.</p>
			<p>A solid week of experimentation should do the trick, rewriting what we've got as we move along. Stay tuned...</p>

			<h3>Baofeng UV-5R ordered!</h3>
			<p>Thanks to donations from some very generous individuals, a brand new Baofeng UV-5R has been ordered. With any luck it'll get here some time next week. Which is good, considering we're running out of things to write without a reference unit.</p>
			<p>We've also decided to go with the new release strategy. The Baofeng UV-5R manual will get released when it's deemed finished. Estimated about a week after we get the reference unit.</p>

			<h3>Reconsidering the release strategy (again)</h3>
			<p>Recently we've come to reconsider our planned release strategy. The unfinished product looks great, that's not the problem. The problem is that, we're feeling that we don't want to release a half finished product to the public.</p>
			<p>What's currently under consideration is this;</p>
			<p>Scrap that version number nonsense. Previously v2.0 would be final release, and also first release.</p>

			<h3>So, website is done.</h3>
			<p>Huzzahs and hail baby. The project website is finally done-ish.</p>
			<p>Well I suppose I should write something here, marking our first post. Updates would be in order I think.</p>
			<p>The progress so far on the Baofeng UV-5R manual is coming along great! We have several chapters "done" and more to come. The idea is still to push version 1.0 when the content of the original manual has been converted, adding more data in consecutive versions.</p>
			<p>On that note, previously we figured that we'd release a gritty 0.9 version to the public until we got all the image rendering in the toolchain working correctly. This has since been scrapped. The current goal is: Get v1.0 ready and out the door on the primary target, i.e. PDF for print. Worry about e-books later.</p>
			<p>No worries, you e-book users out there. Optimized versions are coming. Meanwhile we've established a path in the toolchain to produce iPad-optimized PDFs in addition to the print-optimized PDFs. So if you planned to read your manual on your favourite slate computer system, we've got you covered.</p>
