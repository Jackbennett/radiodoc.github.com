			<h2>What is it</h2>
			<p>The (Chinese) radio Documentation Project, is an Open Source documentation project, aiming to bring you - the users - the best documentation you can get for your equipment.</p>

			<h2>Who we are</h2>
			<p>We are a small team operating from the outskirts of Stockholm, Sweden.</p>

			<h2>Why</h2>
			<p>The Chinese has been flooding the market with these cheap handheld two-way communication radios. And we think that's a good thing! More cheap communication gear to the people!</p>
			<p>However, there is one thing that these cheap Chinese radios lack - proper documentation.</p>
			<p>Most of these radios come delivered with a single sheet manual printed on toilet paper. The language is sub-par, the information lacking, and perhaps worst of all: The little information that <em>is</em> there, isn't even always accurate. Some times it's downright misleading.</p>
			<p>This is where we come in. We aim to bring you the User Manual that these radios <em>Need</em>, and most importantly, the User Manuals that you deserve.</p>
			<hr>

			<h2>Sound great! How can I help?</h2>
			<p>There are a number of ways you can help out.</p>
			<p>The easiest way is to click that orange Donate button in the corner and give us a few bucks. Writing documentation takes a lot time, and when you have as little information to go on as we do, we tend to have to go for the source. Meaning we actually need to buy these two-way radios and put them under test to make sure our documentation is as extensive and accurate as possible.</p>
			<p>Second easiest way, is to file bug-reports. That's right. If you find something that's wrong, inaccurate or just poorly written, file an issue ticket. If you don't want to get a GitHub account to file a ticket, just send us an email and we'll look into it.</p>
			<p>Thirdly, this is an open source project. Which means you're free to download the XML sources, modify them and send us a pull request, right here on GitHub.</p>
